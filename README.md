<p>My Project Features</p>


* My project is employee management. And this project has three rules, Admin, HR, Employee.
* Admin's rule is, he can make someone redundant and any employee as HR.
* The rule of HR is that he can make payment only if he verifies an employee.
* Only HR can view dashboard route private and employee list. No one else can see.
* Again, only the admin can abandon someone, and can also fire, no one else can.
